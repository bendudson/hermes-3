# 1D system with:
#  - no-flow boundary on lower Y
#  - sheath boundary on upper Y
#  - Evolving electron and ion species
#  - heat conduction
#  - Source of heat and particles upstream of X-point
#  - Non-uniform grid, packed towards the target
#  - 100% recycling of ions as atoms, so particle source should go to zero
#  - Ionisation of neutrals as ions
#  - Charge exchange between neutrals and ions
#  - Feedback control of upstream density
#  - Equal electron and ion temperatures
